	The MPLS source routing paradigm provides path control

	RSVP-TE is utilized for intra-AS path control.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Today, BGP-LU <xref target="RFC3107"/>
	is used both as an intra-AS <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls"></xref> and inter-AS
	routing protocol. BGP-LU may advertise a MPLS transport path between
	IGP regions and Autonomous Systems. Those paths may span one or more
	router hops. This document describes advertisement and use of
	one-hop MPLS label-switched paths (LSPs) for traffic-engineering
	the links between Autonomous Systems.
      </t>

      <t>
        Consider <xref target="SINGLE_HOP_LSP"/>: an ASBR router (R2)
        advertises a labeled host route for the remote-end IP address of
        its link (IP3).

	The BGP next-hop gets set to R2s loopback IP address. For the
	advertised Label &lt;N&gt; a forwarding action of 'POP and forward' to
	next-hop (IP3) is installed in R2's MPLS forwarding table.

	Now consider if R2 had several links and R2 would advertise
	labels for all of its inter-AS links.
	By pushing the corresponding MPLS label &lt;N&gt; on the label-stack
	an ingress router R1 may control the egress peer selection.
      </t>

      <t>
	Of course, since R1 and R2 may not be directly connected to
	each other, if the interior routers within AS1 do not maintain
	routes to external destinations, carrying traffic to such destinations
	would require a tunnel from R1 to R2. Such tunnel could be realized
        as either a MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP), or by GRE <xref
        target="RFC2784"/>.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Motivation, Rationale and Applicability">
      <t>
	BGP-LU is often just seen as a 'stitching' protocol for
	connecting Autonomous Systems. BGP-LU is often not viewed
	as a viable protocol for solving the Inter-domain
	traffic-engineering problem.
      </t>
      <t>
	With this document the authors want to clarify the use
	of BGP-LU for Egress Peering traffic-engineering purposes and encourage
	both implementers and network operators to use a widely deployed and
	operationally well understood protocol,
	rather than inventing new protocols or new extensions
	to the existing protocols.

    <section title="Service Route Advertisement">
      <t>In <xref target="SELECTIVE_IBGP_NH_REWRITE"/> a simple
      network layout is shown. There are two classes of BGP speakers:

      <list style="numbers">
	<t>Ingress Routers</t>
	<t>Controllers</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t> Ingress routers receive BGP-LU routes from the ASBRs. Each
      BGP-LU route corresponds to an egress link. Furthermore Ingress
      routers receive their service routes using the BGP protocol.
      The BGP Add-paths extension <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths"/>
      ensures that multiple paths to a given service route may get advertised.
      </t>

      <t>As outlined in <xref
      target="I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-central-epe"></xref>,
      Controllers receive BGP-LU routes from the ASBRs as well.
      However the service routes may be received either using the
      BGP protocol plus the BGP Add-paths extension
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths"/> or alternatively
      The BGP Monitoring protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp"/> (BMP).
      BMP has support for advertising the RIB-In of a BGP router.  As
      such it might be a suitable protocol for feeding all potential
      egress paths of a service-route from a ASBR into a controller.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Egress Next-hop Advertisement">
      <t>
        An ASBR assigns a distinct label for each of its next-hops
        facing an eBGP peer and advertises it to its internal BGP
        mesh. The ASBR programs a forwarding action 'POP and forward'
        into the MPLS forwarding table. Note that the neighboring AS
        is not required to support exchanging NLRIs with the local AS
        using BGP-LU. It is the local ASBR (ASBR{1,2}) which generates
        the BGP-LU routes into its iBGP mesh or controller facing
        session(s). The forwarding next-hop for those routes points to
        the link-IP addresses of the remote ASBRs (ASBR{3,4,5}). Note
        that the generated BGP-LU routes always match the BGP next-hop
        that the remote ASBRs set their BGP service routes to, such
        that the software component doing route-resolution understands
        the association between the BGP service route and the BGP-LU
        forwarding route.
      </t>

      <section title="iBGP meshing and BGP nexthop rewrite policy">
	<t>Throughout this document we describe how the BGP next-hop
	of both BGP Service Routes and BGP-LU routes
	shall be rewritten. This may clash with existing network deployments
        and existing network configurations guidelines which may mandate
        to rewrite the BGP next-hop when an BGP update enters an AS.
	</t>

	<t>The Egress peering use case assumes a central controller
        as shown <xref target="SELECTIVE_IBGP_NH_REWRITE"/>. In order to
        support both existing BGP nexthop guidelines and the suggestion
        described in this document, an implementation SHOULD support
        several internal BGP peer-groups:

        <list style="numbers">
	  <t>iBGP peer group for Ingress Routers</t>
	  <t>iBGP peer group for Controllers</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>The first peer group MAY be left unchanged
	and use any existing BGP nexthop rewrite policy.
	The second peer group MUST use the BGP rewrite policy
	described in this document for both service and BGP-LU routes.
	</t>

	<t>
	Of course a common iBGP peer group and a common rewrite policy
	may be used if the proposed policy is compatible with
	existing routing software implementations of BGP next-hop
	route resolution.

      <section title="Multi-hop eBGP">
	<t>
	  Todays operational practice for load-sharing across
	  parallel links is to configure a single multi-hop eBGP
	  session between a pair of routers. The IP addresses for the
	  Multi-hop eBGP session are typically sourced from the loopback IP
	  interfaces. Note that those IP addresses do not share an
	  IP subnet. Most often those loopback IP addresses are most
	  specific host routes.
	  Since the BGP next-hops of the received BGP service routes
	  are typically rewritten to the remote routers loopback IP
	  address they cannot get immediatly resolved by the receiving
	  router. To overcome this,
          the operator configures a static route with next-hops pointing
	  to each of the remote-IP addresses of the
	  underlying links.
	</t>

	<t>In <xref target="SAMPLE_TOPOLOGY"/> both ASBR{1,3}
	links are examples of a multi-hop eBGP
	advertisement. In order to advertise a distinct label
	for a common FEC throughout the iBGP mesh, ASBR1 and

	BGP Add-paths extension.

	  In addition to offering a distinct BGP-LU label for each egress
	  link, an ASBR MAY want to advertise a BGP-LU label which represents
	  a load-balancing forwarding action across a set of peers.
	  The difference is here that the ingress node gives up
	  individual link control, but rather delegates the
	  load-balancing decision to a particular egress router which
	  has the freedom to send the traffic down to any link
	  in the Peer Set as identified by the BGP-LU label.
	</t>

	<t>
          Assume that ASBR1 wants to advertise a label identifying the
	  Peer Set {ASBR3, ASBR4, ASBR5}.

	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      For the two ASBR{1,3} links in <xref target="SAMPLE_TOPOLOGY"/>,
	      belonging to Peer Set 1,
	      ASBR1 advertises a single BGP-LU route {192.0.2.13/32, label 104}
	      with a BGP next hop of 192.0.2.11. To differentiate
	      this from the ASBR{1,3} single link route-advertisements
	      (which contains the same FEC) it is setting the path-ID to 3
	      and attaching a Peer-Set Community 'Peer Set 1'.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      For the ASBR{1,4} link in <xref target="SAMPLE_TOPOLOGY"/>,
	      ASBR1 advertises a BGP-LU route {203.0.113.7/32, label 104}
	      with a BGP next hop of 192.0.2.11. To differentiate
	      this from the ASBR{1,4} single link route-advertisements
	      (which contains the same FEC) it is setting the path-ID to 2
	      and attaching a Peer-Set Community 'Peer Set 1'.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      For the ASBR{1,5} link in <xref target="SAMPLE_TOPOLOGY"/>,
	      ASBR1 advertises a BGP-LU route {203.0.113.9/32, label 104}
	      with a BGP next hop of 192.0.2.11. To differentiate
	      this from the ASBR{1,5} single link route-advertisements
	      (which contains the same FEC) it is setting the path-ID to 2
	      and attaching a Peer-Set Community 'Peer Set 1'.
	    </t>

	  </list>

	  Finally ASBR1 programs a MPLS forwarding state of 'POP and
	  load-balance' to {203.0.113.3, 203.0.113.5, 203.0.113.7, 203.0.113.9}

       <section title="Locality forwarding bias">
         <t>A router has one or more forwarding plane units. A forwarding
         plane unit consists of one or more interfaces. Forwarding of packets
         to an interface that is member of a forwarding plane unit is cheaper
         than across units. </t>

         <t>A route entry in the forwarding-table may contain multiple
         next-hops, each pointing to a network-interface. When forwarding a
         packet, a forwarding plane unit may optionally provide preference to
         a subset of these next-hops, whose interfaces are its own members.
         This behavior is called "Locality forwarding bias". </t>
       </section>

       <section title="Label per group of peers sharing a locality">
         <t>An ASBR MAY assign a distinct label for the set of eBGP-peers
         that share a forwarding plane unit and advertise it to its internal
         BGP mesh. The ASBR programs a forwarding action 'POP and IP-lookup'
         into the MPLS forwarding table for these labels. While performing
         the IP-lookup, the ASBR MUST perform "Locality-forwarding bias" to
         ensure it only selects next-hops towards eBGP peers that are
         attached to the current forwarding plane unit, where the IP-lookup
         is happening.</t>

         <t>This provides the ingress-peers with ability to steer traffic
         towards a "subset of eBGP-peers" attached to an ASBR, while
         preserving the ability of the ASBR to aggregate the IP prefixes
         received from those eBGP-peers, while re-advertising to the internal
         BGP mesh.</t>

    <section title="Egress Link Protection">
      <t> It is desirable to provide a local-repair based
      protection scheme, in case a redundant path
      is available to reach a peer AS. Protection
      may be applied at multiple levels in the routing stack.
      Since the ASBR has insight into both BGP-LU and BGP service
      advertisements, protection can be provided at the BGP-LU,
      at the BGP service or both levels.
      </t>

      <section title="FRR backup routes">
	<t>
	  Assume the network operator wants to provide
	  a local-repair next-hop for the 172.16/12 BGP
	  service route at ASBR1. The active route
	  resolves over the parallel links towards ASBR3.
	  In case the link #1 between ASBR{1,3} fails
	  there are now several candidate backup paths providing
	  protection against link or node failure.
	</t>

	<section title="Local links">
	  <t>
	    Assuming that the remaining link #2 between ASBR{1,3}
	    has enough capacity, and link-protection is sufficient,
	    this link MAY serve as temporary backup.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    However if node-protection or additional capacity is
	    desired, then the local link between ASBR{1,4} or ASBR{1,5}
	    MAY be used as temporary backup.
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Remote BGP-LU labels">
	  <t>ASBR1 is both originator and receiver of
	  BGP routing information. For this protection
	  method it is required that the ASBRs support the
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-best-external"/>
	  behavior.

	  ASBR1 receives both the BGP-LU and BGP service routes from
	  ASBR2 and therefore can use the ASBR2 advertised label
	  as a backup path given that ASBR1 has a tunnel towards
	  ASBR2.
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Local IP forwarding tables">
	  <t>
	    For protecting plain unicast (Internet) routing
	    information a very simple backup scheme
	    could be to recurse to the relevant IP forwarding
	    table and do an IP lookup to further determine
	    a new egress link.

    <section title="Dynamic link utilization">
      <t>For a software component which controls the egress
      link selection it may be desirable to know about
      a particular egress links current utilization, such that
      it can adjust the traffic that gets sent to a particular
      interface.
      </t>

      <t>
      In <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-link-bandwidth"/>
      a community for reporting link-bandwidth is specified.
      Rather than reporting the static bandwidth of the link,
      the ASBRs shall report the available bandwidth as seen
      by the data-plane via the link-bandwidth
      community in their BGP-LU update message.
      </t>

      <t>
      It is crucial that ingress routers
      learn quickly about congestion of an egress link and hence
      it is desired to get timely updates of the advertised
      per-link BGP-LU routes carrying the available
      bandwidth information when the available bandwidth crosses a
      certain (preconfigured) threshold.
      </t>

      <t>
      Controllers may also utilize the link-bandwidth community among
      other common mechanisms to retrieve data-plane statistics (e.g.
      SNMP, NETCONF)
